This is a chat application built with React, Redux, Socket.io, and Flask. The goal of this application is to show off a pattern for handling websocket-based communication with `await` on the client-side similar to a typical http fetch request, and demonstrate different patterns for handling error and loading states in Redux.

See readme in [server](server/README.md) or [client](client/README.md) directory.
